# Work stoppage data from the FMCS

From 2014-2020, the Federal Mediation and Concilliation Service published data on 577 work stoppage data that their staff tracked in their case management system. 
They stopped publishing this data at the end of 2020, and removed the archival data from their website. This repository archives a copy of the data taken from
the [Internet Archive's copy of the FMCS website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105232710/https://www.fmcs.gov/resources/documents-and-data/), and standardizes the
data.

I have [FOIAed for more recent data, but the FOIA was denied](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/work-stoppage-date-from-january-2021-through-august-2021-119149/). I am appealing.
