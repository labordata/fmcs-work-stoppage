# Work stoppage data from the FMCS

The Federal Mediation and Concilliation Service has previously published data on 14,318 work stoppages that their staff tracked in their case management system. 

The FMCS stopped publishing this data at the end of 2020, and removed the archival data from their website. This repository archives a copy of the data taken from
the [Internet Archive's copy of the FMCS website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210105232710/https://www.fmcs.gov/resources/documents-and-data/), and standardizes the
data.

I have [FOIAed for more recent data, but the FOIA was denied](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/work-stoppage-date-from-january-2021-through-august-2021-119149/). I am appealing.
